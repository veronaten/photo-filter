Live demo - https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/veronaten-JSFE2021Q1/photo-filter/

This project is not finished yet, it is still being developed.
In the application, you can apply effects to the image. I did it using native JavaScript.

Also, the idea of the application is to save the resulting image and be able to upload a new one.
